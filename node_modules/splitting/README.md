Splitting.js is a JavaScript microlibrary designed to split (section off) an element in a variety of ways, such as words, characters, child nodes, and more!

Most Splitting methods utilize a series of `<span>`s populated with CSS variables and data attributes unlocking transitions and animations that were previously not feasible with CSS.

Install with `npm i splitting -s` or [Download](https://github.com/shshaw/Splitting/archive/master.zip).

Consult the [guide & documentation](https://splitting.js.org/guide.html) for more details and installation instructions.
